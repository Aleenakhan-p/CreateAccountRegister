Now! Seemlessly register yourself using my resgister form.
Its super responsive, unique, attractive in its self and most importantly the code is clean and easy to understand.
I am really happy of how it turned out.

The languages used:
1. HTML : For the form structure.
2. CSS : For styling the form into a masterpiece.
3. JS : For adding interactivity in password visibility & profile pic previewing.

ðŸ’¥Its another achievement in my web development projects and its one of the core functionality any web application must have.
